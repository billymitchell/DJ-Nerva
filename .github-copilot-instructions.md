# GitHub Copilot Instructions for DJ Nerva Website

## Project Overview
This is a dynamic single-page website for DJ Nerva, a Baltimore-based DJ specializing in jungle, drum & bass, techno, house, and Baltimore Club music. The site features randomized visual experiences through dynamic hero images, color theming, and rotating taglines.

## Code Style & Standards

### JavaScript
- Use modern ES6+ syntax (const/let, arrow functions, async/await)
- Prefer vanilla JavaScript over frameworks
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Include error handling with try/catch blocks
- Add console.log statements for debugging during development
- Use template literals for string interpolation
- Implement fallback mechanisms for external data sources

### CSS
- Use CSS custom properties (variables) for theming
- Follow BEM methodology for class naming when applicable
- Implement responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Use flexbox and CSS Grid for layouts
- Maintain accessibility standards (WCAG AA compliance)
- Use relative units (rem, em, %) for scalability

### HTML
- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Include proper meta tags for SEO
- Implement Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags
- Use descriptive alt text for images
- Ensure proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3, etc.)
- Include ARIA attributes when necessary for accessibility

## Architecture Patterns

### Data Management
- Store configuration data in JSON files (`image_data.json`, `taglines.json`)
- Use async functions for data fetching
- Implement caching strategies with build hashes
- Handle data loading errors gracefully with fallbacks

### Image Handling
- Maintain separate desktop and mobile image versions
- Use responsive image techniques (picture element, srcset)
- Implement lazy loading for performance
- Include cache-busting parameters for updates

### Color Theming
- Extract colors from images using color analysis libraries
- Apply colors via CSS custom properties
- Ensure WCAG contrast compliance
- Maintain brand consistency while allowing variation

## File Organization

### Core Files
- `index.html`: Main structure and content
- `main.js`: Primary JavaScript functionality
- `simplified-style.css`: All styling and responsive design
- `image_data.json`: Generated manifest of images and colors
- `taglines.json`: Collection of rotating taglines

### Asset Management
- `splash-images/`: Organized in numbered folders (1-13)
- `icons/`: SVG icons for UI elements
- `sound/`: Audio assets (if any)
- `build-image-manifest.js`: Image processing automation

## Key Features to Maintain

### Dynamic Content System
- Random image selection from 13 themed collections
- Color palette extraction and application
- Tagline rotation system
- "Remix" functionality for content refresh

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first CSS approach
- Flexible grid layouts
- Touch-friendly interface elements
- Optimized image delivery

### Music Integration
- Embedded Mixcloud iframes
- Color synchronization with theme

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Images
1. Place desktop and mobile versions in numbered splash-images folders
2. Run `build-image-manifest.js` to update manifest
3. Ensure images follow naming conventions
4. Test color extraction results

### Modifying Taglines
- Edit `taglines.json` array
- Keep taglines concise and brand-appropriate
- Mix professional and humorous tones
- Test for proper display on all screen sizes

### Performance Considerations
- Optimize image file sizes
- Use efficient loading strategies
- Minimize JavaScript bundle size
- Implement proper caching headers

## Brand Guidelines
